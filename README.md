# Brainfuck to C compiler built in javascript
hi. i made this.
## Info
a brainfuck compiler, built entirely in js. Compiles to C, which then itself compiles to an executable binary.
## System requirements
works on redhat/fedora linux, have yet to add compatibility with other OS.
## How to use:
- if not installed yet, install node from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- REQUIRES a C compiler on system, so install that. (run command "gcc" in terminal to check whether it's installed (throws the fatal error "no input files" if installed and working))
- edit the index.bf file using text editor
- if using other file, change the "filepath" variable in index.js
- actually relatively slow. do not use.
